# Security-Homelab-Project

Welcome to my Security Homelab project! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and resource for setting up and managing a secure homelab environment for cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals alike.

**Introduction**
In today's digital age, having hands-on experience with cybersecurity tools and techniques is essential for staying ahead in the ever-evolving field of information security. This Security Homelab project provides a practical environment where you can experiment, learn, and hone your skills in various cybersecurity domains, including network security, penetration testing, threat hunting, and more.

**Network Topology**
The homelab network topology is designed to mimic real-world scenarios, allowing for realistic testing and analysis. Here's an overview of the network setup:

PfSense Firewall VM: Acts as the gateway and provides security features such as firewall, VPN, and intrusion detection/prevention. It has three interfaces:

WAN Interface: Connected to the internet for external communication.
VMnet 1 Interface: Connected to the Soc Analyst PC network (192.168.1.0/24).
Internal Interface: Connected to the internal network for hosting various services and VMs.
VMnet 1: Represents the Soc Analyst PC network with the subnet 192.168.1.0/24.

VMnet 2: Represents another isolated network with the subnet 192.168.2.0/24.

**ISO List**
To set up your Security Homelab environment, you will need the following ISOs:

PfSense: PfSense is an open-source firewall and router platform based on FreeBSD. You can download the PfSense ISO from the official website: PfSense Downloads

Kali Linux Purple: Kali Linux Purple is a specialized version of the Kali Linux distribution tailored for network monitoring and intrusion detection purposes. You can obtain the Kali Linux Purple ISO from the official Kali Linux website: Kali Linux Downloads

Kali Linux: Kali Linux is a popular Linux distribution used for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and security research. You can download the Kali Linux ISO from the official website: Kali Linux Downloads

Metasploitable: Metasploitable is a purposely vulnerable Linux virtual machine that is designed for testing security tools and demonstrating common vulnerabilities. You can download Metasploitable from various sources, including GitHub Releases and VulnHub.

DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application): DVWA is a web application intentionally designed with security vulnerabilities to practice web application security testing. You can download DVWA from the official GitHub repository: DVWA GitHub

Ensure you download the appropriate versions and editions of the software ISOs based on your hardware architecture and requirements. Once you have downloaded the necessary ISOs, you can proceed with setting up your homelab environment according to the provided network topology and instructions.

**Getting Started**
To get started with the Security Homelab project, follow these steps:

Set up a hypervisor environment (e.g., VMware ESXi, VirtualBox).
Deploy the PfSense Firewall VM and configure the interfaces according to the provided network topology.
Create additional VMs or containers for various cybersecurity tools and services using the downloaded ISOs.
Experiment with different security configurations, conduct penetration tests, analyze network traffic, and practice incident response scenarios.
Refer to the documentation and resources provided in this repository for guidance and support.
