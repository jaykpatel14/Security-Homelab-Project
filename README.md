**Security Homelab Project - A Simulated Network Environment**

This document outlines a home lab project designed to simulate a real-world network with various security tools integrated within a VMware Workstation environment.

**Components:**

VMware Workstation: Platform for creating and managing virtual machines.

pfSense: Open-source firewall for network traffic control and security.

Security Onion: Security suite for intrusion detection, log analysis, and security event management.

Splunk: Software platform for real-time data analysis and security monitoring.

Kali Linux: Ethical hacking platform for vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

Windows Server 2019: Provides Active Directory services for centralized user and domain management.

Windows 10 Workstation: Client machine for testing endpoint security configurations.

Metasploitable: Vulnerable target machine for ethical hacking exercises.

**Network Design:**

The home lab will simulate a network with various segments protected by pfSense. Security Onion will be deployed for intrusion detection and log analysis, with data forwarded to Splunk for centralized monitoring. Kali Linux and Purple will be used for penetration testing scenarios. Windows Server will manage user accounts and access control, while Windows 10 serves as a client machine. Metasploitable will act as a target system for testing vulnerabilities.

**Benefits:**

Hands-on experience with security tools.

Understanding of network security concepts.

Practice with security monitoring and incident response.

Development of penetration testing skills.

**Getting Started:**

Install VMware Workstation on your host machine.

Download and configure virtual machine images for pfSense, Security Onion, Splunk, Kali Linux, Windows Server, Windows 10, and Metasploitable.

Set up network interfaces and routing within the virtual environment.

Configure pfSense firewall rules for secure network traffic flow.

Deploy Security Onion for intrusion detection and integrate it with Splunk for centralized logging.

Set up Kali Linux and Purple for penetration testing exercises.

Configure Windows Server for Active Directory and domain management.

Integrate Windows 10 workstation for testing endpoint security.

Utilize Metasploitable for safe vulnerability assessments and exploitation practices.
